The program extends LIBSVM to the area of cost-sensitive classification.
The cost can come from a cost matrix like

0 2 4
1 0 3
5 6 0

meaning that there is a cost of 6 for classifying a class-3 example as class-2,
or a per-example cost vector like

0 9 7

meaning that it would cost 7 when predicting the example as class-3. You can use

-l 3.cost_matrix_file
-l 4.cost_vector_file 

to include the cost information into training. The cost_matrix_file would be K by K, where K is the number of classes (ranging from 1 to K); the cost_vector_file would be N by K, where N is the number of examples.
